So, let\'s dive right into the details! ✨  ## API-Keys for Enhanced Functionality 🔑  Starting now, we have introduced API-Keys to streamline your interactions with our methods. You might have noticed a slight change while making requests – now, all you need to do is include the parameter `X-API-KEY` in the Header of your request. Simple as that!  ## Get Your API-Key in a Snap! ⚡️  Securing your API-Key is a breeze. We\'ve made the process super user-friendly to ensure you can get started quickly. Just head over to our website and fill out a simple form. Once you\'ve done that, your shiny new API-Key will be delivered straight to your email inbox. Easy peasy! 📧  [Get Your API-Key Here](https://api.rarible.org/registration) [Configure SDK with API-key](https://github.com/rarible/sdk#api-querying)  ## Unlock the Power of the Rarible Protocol 🔓  As passionate developers, we know you\'re always hungry for knowledge and eager to explore new frontiers. That\'s why we invite you to discover the incredible world of the Rarible Protocol.
