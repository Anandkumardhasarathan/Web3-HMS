# Blockchain Module - Web3-Based Hospital Management System

## Overview
The **blockchain** module is responsible for handling all blockchain-related operations in the Web3-based hospital management system. It ensures secure and decentralized storage of patient data using NFT-based patient records and smart contracts.

## Features
- **NFT-Based Patient Records**: Each patient is assigned a unique NFT token that stores their medical history securely on the blockchain.
- **Smart Contract for OP Management**: Tracks patient visits, appointments, and doctor assignments.
- **Decentralized Data Storage**: Ensures data integrity and prevents unauthorized modifications.
- **Real-Time Access Control**: Only authorized doctors and hospital staff can access patient data.

## Technologies Used
- **Ethereum Blockchain**
- **Solidity** (Smart Contract Development)
- **Truffle & Ganache** (Development and Testing)
- **Web3.js** (Interaction with the Blockchain)
- **IPFS** (Decentralized File Storage)

## Future Enhancements
- **Integration with Polygon (Matic) for lower gas fees**
- **Decentralized Identity (DID) for Patient Authentication**
- **Automated Insurance Claims using Smart Contracts**
